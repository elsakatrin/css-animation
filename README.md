# css-animation
I had fun with this project! 
I made a little christmas page. 

The header has two animated elements; The texts that slide in at different times on load. I used keyframes for them. Reload the page to see it again.
The Counter is a little bit extra I added with Javascript. 
The Christmas tree has an hover effect on it and spins on hover.
The Cards are animated so they turn around when hovered and reveal text
I have a text that fades in on load. Refresh the page.Reload the page to see it again.
The movie posters have an hover effect on them so when you hover over the image shows on 100% opacity. 

I have two elements that animate in their own.
I have three elements that animate on interaction.

The page is repsonsive. 

Made comments in the code :)
